# :file_cabinet:Job-applications-handling

## What is does?

:file_cabinet: Pontoon is an command-line Java application. The application is designet to help the employment agencies that receive hundreds of job applications every day. The application read a file containing all of the CVs and displays the potential candidates (based on certain criteria) for the interview process.

## :hammer_and_wrench: How I built it?
For the backend I used Java and I built 3 classes:
- CandidatesToInterview that extracts only those candidates that the agency would like to interview.
- JobCandidatesMain is the Main of the application.
- CleaningUp that will take the file that the user inserted and restructured the file for the application.

## :crossed_swords: Challenges I ran into
I knew how to work with Java but I encoountered some problems/bugs when I implemented the class that restructure the files.

- Intitial file.
